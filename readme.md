# Bayesian Net - 2024

## Description

This project implements a **Bayesian Network** with a focus on **inference by enumeration** to accurately estimate gem positions within a grid. A noisy sonar sensor provides positional data, which the network uses to make these estimations. For more details, please refer to `./pdf/consignes.pdf`.

## Features

- **Bayesian Network Implementation**: Solves the problem using a graph-based structure called a "Bayesian Network."
- **Visualization**: Provides a visual demonstration of the inference-by-enumeration algorithm, showing how the agent estimates gem positions based on Bayesian Network predictions.



## Usage

Make sure you have `Python >= 3.11` installed.
